lifecycle policy

1.prevent_destroy

Prevents the resource from being destroyed via Terraform.

Terraform will throw an error if a plan would result in deletion.


lifecycle {
  prevent_destroy = true
}

2.create_before_destroy

Ensures a new resource is created before the old one is destroyed.

Useful for zero-downtime deployments or when a dependency exists.


lifecycle {
  create_before_destroy = true
}

3.ignore_changes

Tells Terraform to ignore changes to specified attributes during a plan/apply.

Useful for fields that change outside of Terraform (e.g., manually updated tags).


lifecycle {
  ignore_changes = [
    tags["LastUpdated"],
    user_data
  ]
}
