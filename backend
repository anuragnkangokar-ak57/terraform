In Terraform, a backend defines where and how Terraform stores its state file — the file that tracks the current state of your infrastructure.
By default, Terraform stores this file locally as terraform.tfstate. But in real-world setups, you usually want to store state remotely, in a backend like:

AWS S3

Azure Blob Storage

Terraform Cloud

Google Cloud Storage

Consul, etcd, etc.




terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "bucket-news3"  # Replace with your S3 bucket name
    region = "us-east-1"  # Specify your AWS region
  }
}
